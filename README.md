## General Info
This is a project that aims to demonstrate the testing of an e-commerce web application using Behaviour-Driven-Development practices. I created this project as part of a larger training course to demonstrate my knowledge of BDD, Specflow, and Selenium Webdriver.

In this project I was tasked with writing two testcases which, in the Gherkin language, I chose to structure as two scenarios under one feature file. Testcase one is to apply a discount code to a cart and verify if the correct amount was deducted, testcase two is to checkout a cart and verify if the new order created is listed under the account that it was purchased with.
